# PDISA: Plant Disease Identification and Severity Assessment

## ðŸŒ¿ **Project Overview**  
PDISA (Plant Disease Identification and Severity Assessment) is a deep learning-based solution for early detection and classification of plant diseases, with a focus on tomato leaf diseases. The model combines transfer learning, image segmentation, and predictive analytics to support agricultural sustainability and food security.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Disease Identification**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, primarily EfficientNet.
- **Severity Assessment**: Employs image segmentation techniques to quantify disease progression.

## ðŸ’» Technical Methodology

### Model Architecture

- **Primary Model**: EfficientNet (EfficientNetB3 for classification) was selected due to its superior accuracy and precision compared to alternatives like ResNet.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages ImageNet-pretrained models, with selective freezing of feature extraction layers and fine-tuning of the classification module.
- **Optimization**: Adam and RMSprop optimizers were tested; Adamax generally improved classification performance.

### Dataset and Scope

- **Dataset Source**: PlantVillage dataset.

- **Target Classes**:

## ðŸ“Š Disease Severity Quantification

- **Method**: Image segmentation (color-based segmentation and thresholding) to isolate infected regions.
- **Severity Calculation**:  
  
  Severity % = (Infected pixels/Total leaf pixels) times 100
 
- **Severity Tiers**:  
  - Class 0: 0â€“5% (Healthy leaves)  
  - Class 1: 6â€“20%  
  - Class 2: 21â€“50%  
  - Class 3: 51â€“100% (Heavy infection)

### Disease Severity Quantification
The **Severity Analysis Module** quantifies the progression of plant disease, a crucial step for delivering accurate treatment recommendations and effectively managing agricultural resources. The process utilizes specific libraries in OpenCV to implement severity prediction module.

#### Infected Region Isolation
The infected regions are isolated using **color-based segmentation** and **thresholding** methods. These steps convert the input image into a processed representation that highlights infected zones, enabling precise identification of diseased leaf areas.

#### Severity Calculation
The severity percentage is computed using the ratio of infected pixels to the total leaf pixels, multiplied by 100:


Severity % = (Infected Pixels/Total Leaf Pixels) times 100

#### Severity Tiers
Based on the computed severity percentage, leaves are categorized into four distinct severity classes:

| Class | Severity Range | Description                  |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------|
| 0      | 0â€“5%           | Healthy leaves               |
| 1      | 6â€“20%          | Mild infection               |
| 2      | 21â€“50%         | Moderate infection           |
| 3      | 51â€“100%        | Heavy infection              |

#### Validation
The severity estimation module confirmed its high reliability and robustness in quantifying disease progression.
